This is a simple web application that allows users to search for information about countries using their names. The app is built using React for the front-end and Express for the back-end.
Features

* Search for countries by name
* View country details including capital, population, currency, language, and flag
* Error handling for country not found or API errors

 ## Technologies Used

* React: a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* Express: a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js
* Axios: a promise-based HTTP client for making API requests
* CORS: a middleware for handling cross-origin resource sharing
* REST Countries API: a free public API for getting country information (https://restcountries.com/v2/)
